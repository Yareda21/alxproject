## About Me

I am passionate about web development and real estate, which inspired me to create this app as a solo developer. My journey into web development started with a fascination for coding in high school, and it has grown into a proficiency in modern web technologies like the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

### Backend

- **Node.js and Express.js**: Powers the backend server and API endpoints, handling requests and responses efficiently.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing property listings and user data, providing flexibility in schema design and scalability.
